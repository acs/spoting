# Explorer

A simple explorer script to play with the Spotify API.

### Authentication
 
You need to have a registered application in Spotify and to add its data to the file **app-credentials.json**.
Use app-credentials-sample.json as a template for it.

You need also a Spotify registered user. The first time you start `explorer.py`  it will use your app config and it will open a web browser so you can login in Spotify.
