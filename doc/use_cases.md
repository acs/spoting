# Use Cases for Spotify Web API

An open document with use cases and ideas on how to do cool things with the Spotity Web API.

All in pre-alpha status just for my personal usage now. But willing to improve it and to collaborate with others.

I will just add new use cases as they come to my mind. No order yet. No action plan. Just a place in which to write things.

### Understading music charms

Why I like some kind of music and not others? What are the genres of music that I like more?

Not just talking about rock, pop, metal, jazz but try to find more specific genres that I like.

Also, Spotify does [analysis in tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-analysis/). 
Is it possible from the to understand whan hve in common by most beloved songs? 

### Finding new artists to follow

Spotify already recommends you new artists using playlists. 
But probably having in mind my own criteria I could do a better job for me.

The analysis of the artists that I already follow can be used as the seed
for getting recommendations from Spotify, and the use this recommendations as
seed for new recommendations until for example, 100 artists are found.

Then decide how to order these 100 artists to explore her music.

How a new genre appears?

Coudl we get trends from the API? I have not seen for example if it is possible 
to get the evolution of followers for an artists.
